Outline

## What is noise?  

All that you leave out of the model

## Sources of noise

- Demographic stochasticity 
- Environmental stochasticity
- Individual heterogeneity
- Spatial variability
- stochastic chaos

## Noise-induced phenonema

- Oscillations (parametric oscillator, stochastic resonance)
- population inflation
- Critical transitions
- Spatial pattern formation
- Population persistence (bet-hedging)
- Species coexistence

## Noise as information

- Measuring stability
- Early warning signals
- maximum entropy methods
